# Prior art

There has been many attempts actually to add directives to React, and the interest is definitely [there](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30408586/what-is-the-react-equivalent-of-an-angular-directive-that-only-works-on-attribut ), but these implementations are limited to a very narrow feature set, and are ill-born for different reasons. Let's see a few:

- https://github.com/peakchen90/babel-plugin-react-directives - Core Vue directives, but with a babel plugin.
- https://github.com/baeyun/directive-x - Babel plugin...
- https://github.com/mkhstar/react-directive - Not a plugin, but the API is tortuous: `<directive.div dirIf={...}>`.
- https://github.com/laurci/react-directive-attributes - Overrides the React API, and it's bundler dependent.
- https://github.com/FullR/react-deep-map - This is something usable, and the project is not dead, but it doesn't step beyond the obvious limitation that it only works on a static element tree.

*React Beyond* doesn't need bundler plugins, and is free of shenanigans. It simply leverages the fact that React is a *functional* library. Note, that React Beyond *does* provide a bundler plugin for Hot Module Reloading to work, just like React does, but it's not necessary for its functionality.
