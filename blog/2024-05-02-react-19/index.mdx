React just announced its version 19 beta with a lot of API change. Among them is making refs regular props, which is very welcome, but it impacted the internals of our code. It wasn't a big deal though, and now I'm happy to claim that from v1.1.2 we're fully ready for React 19 😁.

Have a good day everyone.
