I've read on twitter recently how funny someone finds the royal 'we' when a solo developer creates a library and communicates from behind it. Funny it is, _we_ made it (wink wink).

*React Beyond*, in a nutshell, is a simple tool letting you create higher-order components, which recursively re-apply themselves on the components in the result JSX. It seemlessly penetrates through component boundaries.

It feels magical, but really isn't magic. React is a functional library. I know, I know, hooks and all... But the building blocks are functions. Functions, which return JSX, which references other functions, which return JSX, and so on. This very fact makes it possible to not only create simple higher-order components, but ones with a recursive nature. It infects the entire tree under the component it's applied to.

## The problem

It's really annoying to work with React sometimes. It all starts with those little annoyances, like having to type `className` instead of `class` for <strike>no</strike>historical reasons.

Then you have the conditionals in JSX. You know it's ugly, I know it's ugly, we all know it's ugly. JSX is brilliant in that it's not a template, so we don't have to put expressions in strings (which is ugly too), but breaking the XML hierarchy with JS language structures is just an illness.

I want to mention two more examples. One is the `observer()` HOC from MobX. JS proxies are amazing tools for reactive state management, but in order to implement one for React properly, it needs the knowledge of when a component starts and ends rendering. This necessitates wrapping components in a higher-order component repeatedly.

Lastly, maybe the most annoying one, code like this:

```jsx
<Tooltip text="hello">
  <Button onClick={() => alert('hello')}>Hello</Button>
</Tooltip>
```

is severely unintuitive. Why? Because it elevates a secondary feature above the main functionality. The app works without the tooltip, but not without the button. Still, the tooltip is the boss.

With React Beyond, you can get past to these sorts of problems effortlessly, but it turns out it provides a lot more than that. Heck, you can even create your own framework on top of React with it. What if, let's say, you want to add two-way binding, or signals. Or maybe you want 

## Prior art

There has been many attempts actually to add directives to React, and the interest is definitely [there](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30408586/what-is-the-react-equivalent-of-an-angular-directive-that-only-works-on-attribut ), but these implementations are limited to a very narrow feature set, and are ill-born for different reasons. Let's see a few:

- https://github.com/peakchen90/babel-plugin-react-directives - Core Vue directives, but with a babel plugin.
- https://github.com/baeyun/directive-x - Babel plugin...
- https://github.com/mkhstar/react-directive - Not a plugin, but the API is tortuous: `<directive.div dirIf={...}>`.
- https://github.com/laurci/react-directive-attributes - Overrides the React API, and it's bundler dependent.
- https://github.com/FullR/react-deep-map - This is something usable, and the project is not dead, but it doesn't step beyond the obvious limitation that it only works on a static element tree.

*React Beyond* doesn't need bundler plugins, and is free of shenanigans. It simply leverages the fact that React is a *functional* library. Note, that React Beyond *does* provide a bundler plugin for Hot Module Reloading to work, just like React does, but it's not necessary for its functionality.
