# Usage Patterns

## Multiple features

Beyond Features can be applied anywhere, and they can be nested. After all, they're just higher-order components. But JavaScript doesn't provide a nice way to apply a series of functions to a value:

```tsx 
// ðŸ¥´
const WrappedApp =
  errorFallback()(
    ifElse()(
      loader()(
        classFor()(
          App
        )
      )
    )
  )
```

To ease on this pain, React Beyond exports a `Beyond` component which takes a list of features and applies them in order:

```tsx 
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <Beyond hocs={[
    classFor(),
    loader(),
    ifElse()
    errorFallback()
  ]}>
    <App />
  </Beyond>
)
```

Note that the application order matters. `Beyond` takes the features in the order of application, so it looks reversed from the nested syntax.

In React DevTools, you can see the applied HOCs as a label next to the component, indicating the application order from left to right:
