# Usage Patterns

## Multiple deep HOCs

Deep HOCs can be applied anywhere, and they can be nested. After all, they're just HOCs. But JavaScript doesn't provide a nice way to apply a series of functions to a value:

```tsx 
// ðŸ¥´
const WrappedApp =
  deepTryCatch()(
    deepIfProp()(
      deepLoaderProp()(
        deepClassForProp()(
          App
        )
      )
    )
  )
```

In the [Gallery](/docs/category/gallery), HOC modules, along with the HOC function itself, export a _component_ as well, which provides an alternative syntax. The component's export name only differs from the HOC in that the first letter is uppercase:

```tsx
// method 1:
import { deepClassForProp } from "@react-beyond/classforprop"
const NewComponent = deepClassForProp({ id: 'classFor' })(OldComponent)

// method 2:
import { DeepClassForProp } from "@react-beyond/classforprop"
  // ...
  return (
    <DeepClassForProp id="classFor">
      <App />
    </DeepClassForProp>
  )
```

But this doesn't help much with the indentation hell caused by the nesting.

## Beyond

Therefore, React Beyond provides a way to define a series of HOCs in a flat way. It's a component which takes a list of HOCs and applies them in order:

```tsx 
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <Beyond hocs={[
    deepClassForProp(),
    deepLoaderProp(),
    deepIfProp()
    deepTryCatch()
  ]}>
    <App />
  </Beyond>
)
```

Note that the application order matters. `Beyond` takes the HOCs in the order of application, so it looks reversed from the nested syntax.

In React DevTools, you can see the applied HOCs as a label next to the component, indicating the application order from left to right:
