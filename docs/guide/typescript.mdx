# TypeScript

Those deep HOCs which add magic props to the elements universally, override the React type declarations to add the magic prop to the elements. For example:

```tsx title="deepIfProp.ts"
declare module 'react' {
  interface Attributes {
    _if?: boolean
  }
}
```

This ensures that TypeScript doesn't complain about the magic prop, and that you can Cmd/Ctrl + Click on the prop to go to the declaration.

But this is a global override. Even though deep HOCs runtime mechanics is strictly scoped down to the component's subtree, TypeScript type declarations are global.

## ESLint

If you're using ESLint, there might be one more annoyance with the magic props if the `react/no-unknown-property` rule is enabled (it is, by default). To get rid of this issue, you have to disable the rule:

```yaml title=".eslintrc.yml"
rules:
  react/no-unknown-property: off
```
