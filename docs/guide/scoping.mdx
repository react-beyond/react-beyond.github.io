# Scoping

React Beyond doesn't add any global mechanism to the page. It strictly operates within the subtree of the component it's applied to.

Scoping works with even HMR! What does this mean? Well, if you have the same component in two different places, one within a deep HOC, and the other without, and you change the component, React Fast Refresh will re-render them properly, re-applying the HOCs only to the component that needs it.

```tsx
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client"
import { Beyond } from "react-beyond"
import { deepClassForProp } from "@react-beyond/classforprop"

import App from "./App"

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <div class="" /> {/* <--- Warning: Invalid DOM property `class`. Did you mean `className`? */}
    <Beyond hocs={[deepClassForProp()]}>
      <App />
    </Beyond>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

This is great, but sadly, there's one exception, which is TypeScript. Read more about it in the next chapter.
