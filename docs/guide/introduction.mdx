# Introduction

React Beyond lets you define higher order components (HOCs) that are automatically applied to the entire subtree of the wrapped component, not just its direct JSX output. It walks through the resulting JSX tree and replaces all component elements with their wrapped versions. Its API provides a way to map all JSX elements, map all components, add directive props, and more.

React Beyond
- doesn't change the performance characteristics of the app
- can be nested and it'll be scoped to the wrapped component's subtree
- works with HMR / React Fast Refresh
- directive props are typed, but the typing is global
- doesn't reach beyond class component boundaries
