### `createBeyondComponent(cmp, config)`

Applies a React Beyond configuration to the component `cmp` and returns the new component.

- `cmp`: The component that you want to apply the configuration to.



### Config object

| Property | Type | Description
|---|---|---|
| id | string | The id of the HOC. Must be a unique string. This will appear appear next to the components in React DevTools.
| mapComponent? | (cmp: FC) => FC | A function that maps a component to a new component. If defined, all the components under the deep HOC will be mapped with this function. This function is called _once per mounted components_. |
| invokeRender? | (render, props, ref) => ReactElement | A function which invokes the base component with the passed `props` and `ref`. If defined, all the components under the deep HOC will be rendered through this function. `render` is always the render function, unwrapped from eventual `forwardRef` and/or `memo` wrappings. This function is called _once per render_. Defaults to `(render, props, ref) => render(props, ref)` |
| mapElement? | (el: ReactElement, magicPropValue?: any) => ReactElement | A function that maps `el` to a new element. If defined, all _elements_ under the deep HOC will be mapped with it. `magicPropValue` will only be passed, when `magicProp` is defined; see below. |
| directiveProp? | string | If defined, `mapElement` will only be called, if a JSX element has a prop with `<magicProp>` prop name. If so, React Beyond removes the magic prop from the props object, and calls `mapElement` with (originalProps, magicPropValue). |
