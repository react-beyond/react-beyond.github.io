# deepTwProp

Transforms all `_tw` prop on elements to "className" with clsx() applied. If a `className` prop is already present, it will be merged.

In its runtime logic, this HOC doesn't differ from [deepClsxProp](/docs/gallery/clsx-prop) at all, it has the exact same source code (except the prop name and the HOC id). It might still be useful for separating the tailwind utility classes from the others. In a later development, we may try to add [TypeScript check](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish/status/1329639099498577921) to the `_tw` prop to make sure it's only used for tailwind.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-beyond @react-beyond/twprop
```

In your VSCode settings, add this config:

```json
  "tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    "_tw=\"([^\"]*)"
  ],
```

## Usage

```
deepTwProp(opts: {
  id?: string
} = {}): HOC
```

- `id` - The id of the HOC. Defaults to `"twProp"`.

(Check out the [Usage Patterns](/docs/guide/usage-patterns) page to see alternative syntaxes.)

## Examples

```tsx
import { Beyond } from "react-beyond"
import { deepClsxProp } from "@react-beyond/twprop"

const el = (
  <Beyond hocs={[deepTwProp()]}>
    <App />
  </Beyond>
)
```

Elements like this under `<App />`:

```tsx
<div class="some-class" _tw={['mx-6', true && 'bg-red-400']} />
```

will turn into this:

```tsx
<div className="some-class mx-6 bg-red-400" />
```
