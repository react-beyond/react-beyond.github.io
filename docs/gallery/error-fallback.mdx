# errorFallback

Wraps all components in the subtree in an ErrorBoundary.

This HOC is mainly for demonstration purposes, as it pollutes the component tree in DevTools. [deepTryCatch](/docs/gallery/try-catch) has the same capability, but is much more practical!

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-beyond @react-beyond/errorboundary
```

## Usage

```
deepErrorBoundary(opts: {
  id?: string
  fallback?: (componentName: string) => ReactElement
} = {}): HOC
```

- `id` - The id of the HOC. Defaults to `"errorBoundary"`.
- `fallback` - A render function which gets the errored component's name and returns a ReactElement to render in its place. Defaults to a `<div>` which takes up the available space and shows `[<component name> error]` in the middle.

(Check out the [Usage Patterns](/docs/guide/usage-patterns) to see alternative syntaxes.)

## Examples

```tsx
import { Beyond } from "react-beyond"
import { deepErrorBoundary } from "@react-beyond/errorboundary"

const el = (
  <Beyond hocs={[deepErroBoundary()]}>
    <App />
  </Beyond>
)
```
