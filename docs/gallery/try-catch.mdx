# deepTryCatch

Makes all component error tolerant with a fallback element.

This HOC is similar to [deepErrorBoundary](/docs/gallery/error-boundary) in its function, but instead of wrapping all the components in an ErrorBoundary, it wraps the invocation of the render function in a try-catch block.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-beyond @react-beyond/trycatch
```

## Usage

```
deepTryCatch(opts: {
  id?: string
  fallback?: (componentName: string) => ReactElement
} = {}): HOC
```

- `id` - The id of the HOC. Defaults to `"tryCatch"`.
- `fallback` - A render function which gets the errored component's name and returns a ReactElement to render in its place. Defaults to a `<div>` which takes up the available space and shows `[<component name> error]` in the middle.

(Check out the [Usage Patterns](/docs/guide/usage-patterns) to see alternative syntaxes.)

## Examples

```tsx
import { Beyond } from "react-beyond"
import { deepTryCatch } from "@react-beyond/trycatch"

const el = (
  <Beyond hocs={[
    deepTryCatch()
  ]}>
    <App />
  </Beyond>
)
```
