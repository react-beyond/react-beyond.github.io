# loader

Renders a loader mask on top of elements with a truthy `x-loader` prop.

It provides a `loaderMask` config. But it doesn't only render the `loaderMask` in place of the component: the layout wouldn't match. In order to make the `loaderMask` cover up the exact same area as the component, it adds additional wrappings around the base component to provide a container for the `loaderMask` with the proper size. As there's no safe way in CSS to wrap a DOM element without affecting the layout and keep the wrapper a positioned context, `deepLoaderProp`'s wrapper component tries to acquire the `style.display` property of the base component's root DOM node in a useLayoutEffect hook, and uses that display value for the wrapper elements. In most cases it works well.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-beyond @react-beyond/loader
```

## Options

- `id` - The id of the feature HOC. Defaults to `"loader"`.
- `loaderMask` - The loader mask to render. Defaults to a component which takes up the container's area (see above) and shows "Loading..." in the center.

(Check out the [Usage Patterns](/docs/guide/usage-patterns) to see alternative syntaxes.)

## Examples

```tsx
import { Beyond } from "react-beyond"
import { deepClsxProp } from "@react-beyond/loader"

const el = (
  <Beyond hocs={[loader()]}>
    <App />
  </Beyond>
)
```
